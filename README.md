# Marketing-549Q_19

Course Overview

Digital marketing and ecommerce are dramatically changing the way businesses interact with their customers and offer their products and services. A customer, in turn, has the ability to assess/evaluate products and brands, inform themselves of competitive offerings, and make purchase decisions based on a firm’s online presence and their online interaction with the brand and product/service. As marketing dollars shift towards online platforms from traditional channels, it presents a plethora of exciting challenges and opportunities that marketers need to be cognizant of to design successful strategies. Earlier, firms with large advertising budgets were very successful with traditional promotional vehicles however, with the advent of digital advertising, small and medium size firms can also be very competitive because targeted online advertising  are not costs prohibitive- given the type of measures such as pay per click or pay per impressions. From web to mobile, email to apps, and social media to user-generated content, this course will provide students with hands-on tools and techniques to plan and create a successful digital marketing strategy. 

Specifically, this course has been designed to provide students with an understanding of various aspects of digital marketing, the digital touchpoints and channels that affect customer experience and how to utilize and leverage the digital data across various touchpoints for better marketing decisions. Students will learn how to assess a company’s digital presence and have the ability to make recommendations to improve a company’s brand positioning using digital data, analytical tools, and models. This course is intended towards quantitatively oriented students who will be exposed to core marketing techniques using online advertising and social media analytics tools to meet business objectives. The main goal of this course is to help students understand digital marketing methods, from a variety of perspectives- as analysts, consumers and managers. We will emphasize many fundamental concepts and also look at modeling approaches for executing key marketing tactics. 

Basic marketing and statistical concepts are integrated throughout the course to cover both conceptual as well as applied nature of digital data and analytics in marketing. The course will be hands on in nature, and students will be expected to work with marketing datasets, based on lectures and class discussions.

Textbooks and Assignments

The world of digital marketing is changing at a phenomenal pace, thus we will not be using any textbooks, however, each week you will be assigned readings that will be sourced from leading industry publications and websites (Harvard Business School White Papers, Experian, eMarketer, SEOMoz.org, ClickZ.com, etc.)

The main course materials will be available in the lecture slides, handouts, text materials, readings, that will be posted. Additional resources will be given to the students in the class as handouts or posted on canvas. There are two optional reference books that will be placed on reserve for you at the Fuqua Library:

Each homework is designed to make you think critically about the topics discussed in class. Thus, each assignment will challenge you to reflect on a number of different topics and models discussed in the class. In addition, you will have to expand on the problems we solve together in the class, by combining them and critically applying them to a variety of different scenarios. Some open ended questions may have more than one right answer. 

The quizzes will be shorter, mostly multiple choice and will have fewer exercises and calculations. 
The lecture slides will cover all the topics that will be part of the homework and the quiz but may not have the details – they are not meant to substitute the books and additional readings provided in the class.
